# BouncingBalls

## Why is this a thing?
This is a very basic program designed so that I could gather some experience using raylib-d.
It is not meant to be an example of good D code, nor a good example of good raylib technique.

I figured it might be a good idea to have more resources for raylib-d available, rather than less and so
posted it up here for others to see.

Therefore **expect** messy code and less than optimal ways of achieving things.

Lets also not talk about my circle collision handling...

## Resources
If you're new to raylib-d then this repository may have some useful examples for you; however,
I recommend you check out the following resources which helped me to create this program.
